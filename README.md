# Config: a simple specialization

This is a testing package for personal use. Use it at your own risk.

This package defines a class that derives from
[lib/configparser](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.12/Lib/configparser.py)
to define a config file that saves itself if it detects it's not present in
a specific folder.
